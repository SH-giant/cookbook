        Roll each piece into an oval about 1/8 inch thick. Sprinkle some cilantro on top and press lightly to adhere.
        Preheat a cast iron skillet until very, very hot, about 5 minutes. Cook each naan until large bubbles form, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip over, press gently, and cook until bubbles on the bottom are charred, 2 to 3 minutes more.
